        I’m someone who finds joy in both the serenity of nature and the comfort of indoor life. Whether it’s exploring the mountains, relaxing by the sea, or enjoying a cozy movie night and diving into video games, I embrace it all with equal passion.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed mb-4">
        You could say I’m a jack of all trades — always curious, always learning, and always up for new adventures.
      </p>
      <p className="text-lg leading-relaxed">
        I'm looking to build a career that mirrors my passion for exploration — but in the digital realm. The world of coding allows me to channel my creativity, problem-solving, and adaptability into something impactful. I want a career where I can constantly discover, experiment, and grow — just like I do in life.
